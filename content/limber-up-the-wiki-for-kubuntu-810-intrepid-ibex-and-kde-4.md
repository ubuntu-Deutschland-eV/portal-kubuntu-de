The countdown to the release of Kubuntu Intrepid Ibex and the automatic
change-over to KDE 4 is heating up! What should the user expect? What
will be different? What has changed? What is to consider? How can I make
the transition? Shall I wait?


To answer these questions we call for participation and we will reward
it! Lots of users around kubuntu-de.org got their experience with KDE 4
on Hardy and some may have tested pre-versions of Intrepid Ibex, too. We
call on those and every one interested: write an (or more than one if
you like) article in the wiki to one of many proposed topics and get the
chance to win a T-Shirt, a mug or a mouse pad from KDE. For each
finished article, a piece of news on the portal will be published.


<!--break--><!--break-->

The requirements are low: joy in writing, zest for Kubuntu, fun in
experimenting with applications and settings as well as some time, an
installed KDE 4, though Intrepid Ibex RC would be best and also an
wiki/forum account at kubuntu-de.org is required to get started. The
articles have to be written in German, since we are the German speaking
Kubuntu community.


How can I participate?


-   Take one of the proposed
    [topics](http://wiki.kubuntu-de.org/Team:Redaktion/ArtikelKDE4Themen "http://wiki.kubuntu-de.org/Team:Redaktion/ArtikelKDE4Themen"){.external
    .text}
    
    
-   Fill in your name in the template
    
    
-   Just do it ;)
    
    


But, but...!?

    -   Ask in the IRC channel \#kubuntu-de.org on irc.freenode.net

        .text}

    -   A structure is proposed, you'll find it in the template

    -   If you don't know how to do it ask as described above
        
        

    
    
-   What if I want to write two or even more articles?

    
    -   No Problem! When your current one is finished, don't hesitate to
        choose another topic
