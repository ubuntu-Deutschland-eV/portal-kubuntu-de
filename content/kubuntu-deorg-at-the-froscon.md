This weekend, for the second time, the
[FrOSCon](http://www.froscon.org/ "http://www.froscon.org"){.external
.text}, a conference for Free and Open Source Software, is taking place
in St. Augustin, near Bonn during this weekend. The German speaking
Kubuntu community will be represented there, as we were at the lastest
similar events. Due to our numerous volunteers, we are happy to be able
to give guest of the FrOSCon an insight of the opportunities of Kubuntu.
Our booth is right next to the ones of KDE and Amorak. More about the
FrOSCon and our participation will be provided at this website in the
very near future.


Our webcam is available at <http://webcam.kubuntu-de.org>.
